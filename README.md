# Python AST Parser

A Python tool for parsing, analyzing, and visualizing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of Python code. This tool reads a Python file, constructs its AST, records detailed information about each node in a hierarchical structure, and saves the output as a JSON file for easy inspection and further processing.

## Features

- Parses Python source code into an AST.
- Records detailed information about each node, including type, name, value, line number, and return type (for functions).
- Organizes node information hierarchically to reflect the tree-like structure of the AST.
- Saves the AST structure to a JSON file for easy inspection and further processing.

## Installation

To use this tool, simply clone the repository and navigate to its directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-ast-parser.git
